Warning: This is a simple server for use in testing or debugging Angular applications
locally. It hasn't been reviewed for security issues.

Binding this server to an open connection can result in compromising your application or
computer. Using a different host than the one passed to the "--host" flag might result in
websocket connection issues. You might need to use "--disable-host-check" if that's the
case.
    
Component HMR has been enabled.
If you encounter application reload issues, you can manually reload the page to bypass HMR and/or disable this feature with the `--no-hmr` command line option.
